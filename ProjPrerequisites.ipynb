    "Linux terminals are command-line interfaces that allow users to interact with the operating system through text-based commands. \n",

    "You do not have to use the Linux terminal if you do not want to. To complete the project, you can either use Codespaces (see below) or have a local Anaconda installation and GitHub Desktop (see below)."

    "## GitHub basics\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for software development. It relies on an open-source version control system called [Git](https://git-scm.com/). De facto, all software development projects today use some kind of version control. It allows us to develop the code together as a team, keep track of changes, suggest new features, and merge everything in a simple workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic object is a *repository* (\"repo\"), which stores all of the source code for the project.\n",
    "You can create your repo or *clone* (GitHub jargon for copying) an existing repo.\n",
    "You can also *fork* a repo, which is similar to cloning, but you typically do it when you want to contribute your changes back to the original repo and not just develop your version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each repository can have several *branches*. The default one is called *main*.\n",
    "When you want to implement a new feature, the typical workflow is to clone the repository and create a new branch dedicated to your feature. In this way, you will not change the main version of the code while you work. Next, you develop the new feature by adding or editing the source code. Every time you would like to save a checkpoint that you could return to if needed, you should *commit* your changes and *push* them to update the remote repository. When you want to discuss your changes and consult with your team, you can create a *pull request* on GitHub.\n",
    "Once you are done with all changes, you must *merge* your branch back with the original main branch. This is done by closing the pull request and merging.\n"

It enables developers to create, edit, and run code without setting up a local development environment. This service supports Visual Studio Code, allowing for a seamless and familiar coding experience. Additionally, it facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work in the same environment, thereby improving productivity and simplifying the development workflow.\n",

On the left side of the window, click the source control button, enter an indicative message (\"initial commit\" will suffice) and click 'Publish Branch'. A selection menu will open at the top of the screen, with the option to create a private or public repository. Remember that full functionality for private repositories is enabled only for pro users.
