Create a separate run script for each one of the sections in the notebook (`run_harmonic.py` and `run_Ar.py`), run the simulations, and answer the questions.

    "## Test Driven Development\n",
    "Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. The process involves writing a test for a specific functionality, running the test to see it fail (since the feature is not yet implemented), and then writing the minimum amount of code required to pass the test. After the code passes the test, it is refactored to improve its structure while ensuring that all tests still pass. TDD promotes better design, higher code quality, and ensures that the software is thoroughly tested from the outset, leading to fewer bugs and more maintainable code."

    "### Doctest\n",
    "Under TDD guidelines, you will work with python's doctest module. it allows you to embed test cases directly in your docstrings and run them as part of your documentation. By writing tests within the docstrings of your functions, classes, or modules, doctest can execute these snippets of code to verify that they produce the expected output. This approach is useful for ensuring that your code examples in documentation are accurate and up-to-date. It also serves as a lightweight testing framework, making it easy to validate small units of code without needing a separate test script. Doctest promotes writing clear and executable documentation, which can improve code reliability and maintainability. "
