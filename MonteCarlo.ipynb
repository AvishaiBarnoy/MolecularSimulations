    "Now that you have written your own MD code, you have a recipe for evaluating thermodynamic properties of systems in the microcanonical ensemble. But what would you do if you wanted to get a different ensemble? You would have to evaluate Eq.[](ensemble_av_NVT). Effectively, this means evalauting very **high-dimensional integrals**, since $\\bf x$ is of dimension $6N$ where $N$ is the number of atoms. How could this be done in practice? By running many simulations at different total energies, and taking the weighted averages of the thermodynamic property according to the Boltzmann weight. This is very expensive. Monte carlo is a clever way to evaluate such integrals."
